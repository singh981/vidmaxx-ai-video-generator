## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Working

If a command doesn't seem to work:

1. **Check repository permissions**: Ensure CodeRabbit has necessary access
2. **Verify command syntax**: Use exact command format with `@coderabbitai`
3. **Look for responses**: Check PR comments for CodeRabbit's response
4. **Use help command**: Run `@coderabbitai help` for guidance
5. **Check configuration**: Some commands require specific settings

### Common Issues

**Command ignored:**

- Ensure `@coderabbitai` is mentioned exactly
- Check that CodeRabbit has repository access
- Verify the command is in the correct location (description vs comment)

**No response:**

- Wait a few minutes for processing
- Check if CodeRabbit is paused or ignored
- Verify repository permissions

**Feature not available:**

- Check if feature requires Pro plan
- Verify feature is enabled in configuration
- Ensure feature is enabled in CodeRabbit settings

## Configuration Dependencies

Many commands are affected by configuration settings:

- **Automatic reviews**: `reviews.auto_review.enabled`
- **Docstring generation**: `reviews.finishing_touches.docstrings.enabled`
- **Unit test generation**: `reviews.finishing_touches.unit_tests.enabled`
- **High-level summaries**: `reviews.high_level_summary`
- **Sequence diagrams**: `reviews.sequence_diagrams`

## Best Practices

1. **Use commands appropriately**: Use review commands when automatic reviews are disabled
2. **Provide context**: Use natural language to give CodeRabbit context about your PR
3. **Be specific**: When asking questions, be specific about what you want to know
4. **Review generated content**: Always review docstrings and tests before merging
5. **Use pause/resume**: Pause reviews during rapid development, resume when ready
